Project Description:
Conways Game of Life creates a grid of cells that interact with each other.  Cells have the ability to be either alive or dead.  When a live cell has two or three neighbors, it lives, and if does not, it dies.  If a dead cell has exactly three neighbors, it comes to life. 

Overview of the Code:
Conways has three classes: Cell, Display, and Main. Main creates the display and JFrame and runs the methods inside them.  Display initializes the cells, the grid, and the buttons.  It has Start/Stop, Clear, and Next buttons.  It also has the methods that calculate whether or not a cell would be alive in the next turn.  Cell has the method for calculating the number of neighbors that the cell has.  It also has the methods for drawing the cells.
