Conway's Game of Life

Authors: Jennifer Zwiebel and Sophia Vera

Project Description: This is a game on a grid. The user can make cells alive by clicking or dragging their mouse. When the game starts, the program will make a decision of whether each cell should be alive based off of the neighboring cells. If an alive cell has 2 or 3 alive neighboring cells, it will survive, if it had a different number of alive neighboring cells it will die. If a cell that is not alive has exactly 3 neighboring cells, it will come to life. There is a stop and start button to stop or start the game, a clear button to clear all of the cells alive, and a next button to show the next update of the game.

Overview of Code Structure: There is a class Cell which represents and individual cell and a class Display which represents an individual game.
